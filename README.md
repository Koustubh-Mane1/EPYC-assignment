# EPYC-assignment
Message - Scheduler
# Current Progress
I have made the modal and the shortcut , now I have to make a database to search for the multiple member and hybrid choice of channel and member, next I have to get the timezone details from the user.read scope, then the basic logic is easy as I have to add the difference between the timezones of the sender and receiver and add them to the projected time. After that from the data base I have to schedule a message for each user with its different time, and then send the messages.
